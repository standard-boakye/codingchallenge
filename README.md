# codingchallenge

This is my solution to the coding challenge.

I chose to work on mockup3.png

I noticed that the mockups were mainly designed for the web.

Because this a windows application and the mockups are mainly for the web, there will be some slight changes in the UI design.

I also didn't include the database access code as the challenge did not ask for that.



Once again, thank you for the opportunty and hope to speak with you soon
